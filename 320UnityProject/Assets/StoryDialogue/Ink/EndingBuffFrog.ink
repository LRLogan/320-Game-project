>>Only a few weeks have passed, and we've already been getting so many new reports and requests!
Well, I say "we", but I myself haven't been assigned to any of them for some reason...
And Detective Toadshoe seems extremely stressed from all the new work.
I wish I could help, but no one will talk to me or tell me what's going on.
Surely this doesn't have anything to do with the case I worked on, right...?
I mean, it <i>was</i> Buff Frog, wasn't it?
I keep hearing rumors that the sudden increase in crime rate is because of Buff Frog's arrest, but those are just rumors...
After all, <i>I</i> was the one who was actually there, right...?
It's not like...<i>I'm</i> the reason for all this chaos...
...right...?
